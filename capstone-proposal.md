## Project: Ski Lift Route Mapping

### Project's Purpose or Goal: 

_The purpose is to be able to use javascript graphs to construct nodes and optimal paths for ski trail runs._ 

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 

_React or React Native App._ 

1) Plot distances between points on a graph

2) Use Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to get fastest routes

3) Implement items 1 and 2 on a ski trail map

_I’ll need to learn a lot about graphing search algorithms. Using nodes, edges, and pathways._

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next?

_If I can introduce mapping to find an optimal route, I’d like to add this functionality to specific ski mountains. I.E. I want to be able to scale it for multiple places, not just one. I’d also want to make it mobile._

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

_To be honest, I know this is going to be quite a challenge, and I’m not entirely sure I’ll succeed, but it does solve a real-world problem and would be useful. I just hope I can get it running by presentation time._

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

_Have mercy if I can’t get this 100% working. I did not want to do a cookie-cutter-type project, but I may be singing another tune in a week or so._


# NOTE: I do not have the programming chops at this juncture to do this project. I'm essentially trying to re-code Google Earth.

_I will submit another proposal this weekend._
