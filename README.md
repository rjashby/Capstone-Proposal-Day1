Research & Planning Log:


Day 1 Research Notes for “commit” history:

8:15:  Crash course in graph search algorithms.

8:40: Meet up with other students for better approach. Suggestion to use Python's map plot lib. 

8:50 - 9:20: Coding along with airport graphing algorithm. Still in progress.

9:30- 10:15: Research rest syntax in mapping graph. Graph works. 

10:20 - 10:50: Break to eat

10:50 - 11:35: Research weighted graphs - following this tutorial: https://adrianmejia.com/data-structures-for-beginners-graphs-time-complexity-tutorial/

11:35 - 12:10: Taking notes and continuing research. Added Notes.txt file.

12:15 - 1:25: Add additional notes and try an object oriented approach

1:30 - 2:00: Add vertices and edges to graphs. Add Graph.js file. 

2:00 - 2:30: Implementing additional searches, but need to read up on queue data structures and methods:

2:30 - 3:00: Finish reading: https://adrianmejia.com/data-structures-for-beginners-graphs-time-complexity-tutorial/#Breadth-first-search-BFS-Graph-search
    - Add Queue.js - implementation of a queue. 
    - still confused. taking a break
